## Summary

An ambitious software engineer interested in solving challenges and gain new knowledge everyday.

Have a solid background and hands-on experience in software engineering by internships I got while studying and projects I worked on.

### Experience

##### Production Engineer Intern @ Facebook

Responsible for delivering a complete project going through all the SDLC from design, prototyping,
implementation, testing, deployment and communicating with the customer.
The challenge in the project was its scale as it was monitoring all the devices' firmware in the Facebook fleet
by making heavy calls to lots of services, processing the data then drawing charts with the Inferred
information.
